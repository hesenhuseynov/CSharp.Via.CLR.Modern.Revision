# CSharp.Via.CLR.Modern.Revision

A modern, developer-focused revision of classic CLR/.NET fundamentals (inspired by timeless books like *CLR via C#*), rewritten with a **.NET 8/9 mindset**.

This repository is a **living book / notes project**: I read, rewrite, modernize, and validate concepts such as **managed modules, assemblies, metadata, JIT, GC, deployment models (single-file, trimming, NativeAOT)**, and more.

---

## 🎯 Why this repo exists

Many classic CLR resources are excellent, but some parts become outdated due to:
- .NET Core / .NET 5–9 changes
- Cross-platform hosting & deployment tooling
- New runtime features (Tiered JIT, OSR, PGO)
- Modern packaging (single-file, trimming, ReadyToRun, NativeAOT)

My goal is to keep the **core fundamentals** intact while updating the explanations to match **modern .NET reality**.

## 🔍 How it’s written (AI-assisted, author-controlled)

I do use AI tools (ChatGPT/GPT) to:
- help rewrite and structure explanations,
- propose clearer examples and diagrams,
- catch contradictions and improve readability.

But **every section is reviewed by me**:
- I validate technical claims,
- I edit wording to avoid overclaims,
- I correct logic and consistency issues,
- I keep the final decision and writing direction under my control.

So the content is **AI-assisted**, but **human-reviewed and curated**.

## 📚 Structure

- `book/` — main chapters (Markdown)
- `book/chapter1/` — Chapter 1 drafts and revisions

Each file is written to be readable directly on GitHub.

---

## ✅ Quality rules I follow

- No “marketing claims” (e.g., absolute statements that aren’t always true)
- Prefer precise language over vague phrasing
- Modern .NET defaults (5–9 / 8–9) unless explicitly marked as legacy
- When a topic is legacy/rare (e.g., multi-module assemblies), it’s labeled clearly

## 🧭 Status

This is an **in-progress** project. Chapters evolve as I learn and verify more details.
